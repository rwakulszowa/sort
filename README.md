# sort
Sorting algorithms implemented in readable Scala
## Description
The aim of this project is to provide implementations of the most popular sorting algorithms in Scala, using the functional programming paradigm.

Along the implementations, this project provides some ways to reason about performance. Currently it's possible to run and time each algorithm for a given input. *Soon*, more input kinds, some fancy plots and nice logging will appear. Anyways, if you want to see how a given algorithm performs, this is a good place to start.

I put emphasis on readabilty and simplicity, not on super-optimal performance. In fact, you will find here some algorithms that actually suck. I avoided inheritance to the implementation details as explicit as possible.

## Contributing
If you're reading this - well, Hi!

If there's an algorithm you'd like to see here, just implement it or create an issue. Even if it is bad (especially if it is, because why not :) ).

## TODO
- Find a less lame name :/
