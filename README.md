# sort
Sorting algorithms implemented in (relatively) readable Scala

## Description
The aim of this project is to provide implementations of the most popular sorting algorithms in Scala, sticking to the functional programming paradigm.
Why functional paradigm? Because it is hip. Why scala? Because I was dumb. This is crearly not the language for this kinda thing.

Along the implementations, this project provides some ways to reason about performance. Currently it's possible to time each algorithm on a given input and to print a tree of intermediate transformations.
If you want to see how an algorithm works, this is a good place to start.

I put emphasis on readabilty and simplicity, not on super-optimal performance. In fact, you will find here some algorithms that actually suck. I avoided inheritance to the implementation details as explicit as possible.

## Contributing
If you're reading this - well, Hi!

If there's an algorithm you'd like to see here, just implement it or create an issue. Even if it is bad (especially if it is, because why not :) ).

## TODO
- Find a less lame name :/
- Give up and rewrite this in Python.
